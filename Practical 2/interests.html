                <h2>Art</h2>
                <h3>Traditional Art</h3>
                <p>I originally began my journey to actively improving my art at the age of 11. I had seen 
                    so many artists that I admired and had decided that I wanted to be able to do what they did.
                </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, this journey was not a smooth one. During the majority of my High School years
                     I recieved mass amounts of bullying for nothing other than trying to improve my passion. This 
                     had a very big weight on the confidence I had in my work, but I have since been able to rebuild
                      this in the past few years.
                </p>
                <h3>Digital Art</h3>
                <p>Around the age of 14, I was bought my first digital drawing tablet by my parents. This rocketed
                     me into the world of digital art and all of the creative freedom that came with it. I am still
                      to this day improving and working on my digital art as you can always find room for improvement.
                </p>
