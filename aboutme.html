            <p> Hi! My name is Aimee, and I'm a second year student on the Software Engineering course
                at Keele University. My hobbies consist of reading, drawing, and playing my instruments!
                Currently, I am employed in the SU Kitchen in order to make some income whilst completing
                my degree. My favourite genre of movies is horror and I would have to say that my favourite
                is The Babadook.
            </p>
